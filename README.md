# Microfrontends with React
This project's goal is to study how microfrontends work, following along the exercises provided in [this Udemy's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/microfrontend-course/)

###Running locally
1. Clone this repo
2. Inside each directory (cart, products and container) run:

```
npm instal
npm run start
```
3. Access **container** at `http://localhost:8080/` to see all contents grouped in the `container` application. 
You can access `http://localhost:8081/` to see only the `products` application
Or `http://localhost:8082/` to see only the `cart` application.
